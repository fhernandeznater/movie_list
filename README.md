Movie List is a Simple Command Line Tool to help you sort through movies in your collection. When I leave for vacation, I'll sometimes bring movies with me from my own collection and from the library. Instead of having to look through all the movies every time I want to find something to watch, using this tool lets you input movies and sort them by rating or year.

To run, type "ruby app.rb" in the terminal.

- Ruby version: `3.2.1`
